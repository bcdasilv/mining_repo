Better dispose method.. 
added @Override annotations and fixed brace placement
If the current buffer is on a VFS that is not browseable (ex:http), trying   to open a new file was trying to browse the path of the current file giving   an error
use of Task API in VFS Browser
delatedAWT -> delayedAWT
delatedAWT -> delayedAWT and fixed indentation
no reason to rename a file if the new name is the same

If I'm unable to create a unique filename I will not copy it and show an error
New method MiscUtilities.getCompleteBaseName() to return the complete base name of a file (until the last .)
Better way to paste multiple files to VFS Browser  - New constructors for CopyFileWorker:   CopyFileWorker(Component comp, VFSFile[] vfsFiles, String target)   CopyFileWorker(Component comp, VFSFile[] vfsFiles, String target,    			Behavior behavior)   CopyFileWorker(Component comp, File[] files, String target)   CopyFileWorker(Component comp, File[] files, String target, Behavior behavior)   to allow copy of multiple files at the same time    - New VFS.copy() methods:   copy(ProgressObserver progress, VFS sourceVFS, Object sourceSession,   	String sourcePath, VFS targetVFS, Object targetSession,   	String targetPath, Component comp, boolean canStop,   	boolean sendVFSUpdate)   copy(ProgressObserver progress, String sourcePath,String targetPath,    	Component comp, boolean canStop, boolean sendVFSUpdate) 
Simplified CopyFileWorker to take a List<String> as source
Fixed javadoc warnings.
Fixed bug #3493415, an error messsage on double-clicking multiple directories.
Fixed IO error when changing VFS Browser filter content  (#3502820) The reason was that ThreadUtilities.runInDispatchThread() runs the task immediately if already in DispatchThread, but in that case we want to wait to run it after all EDT work has been done

incomplete api documentation of VFSBrowser constants (#3562060) 
Rolling back rev# 22360 - turns out BROWSER_DIALOG is actually not a directory-restricted browser, but just a multi-file open dialog.  I will properly document it in the next commit.
