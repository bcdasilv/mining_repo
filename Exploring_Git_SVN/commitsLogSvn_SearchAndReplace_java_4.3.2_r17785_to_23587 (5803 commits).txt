Refactored the HyperSearchRequest to a Task
- The "buffer" variable is always the current buffer and not the buffer   where the replacement occurs when using beanshell snippet replacement   (#3043118)
Fixed a memory leak in the beanshell snippet replacement #3043132
use of CharSequence instead of String to reduce memory usage
In search and replace when replacing by a beanshell snippet, it is now possible to use multiple statements instead of  only one statement. To do that, enclose your code in braces (patch #3002207)
Fixed incorrect behaviors of Find Next/Previous happened when invoked at a start/end of line, and corrected wrong javadoc comments of SearchMatcher#nextMatch() with its duplicates, as the cause of problem. (SF.net bug #2953604)  All of callers of SearchMatcher#nextMatch() in sight, are now passing correct arguments. The javadoc comments had been out of date for years. 
Added an option to search for entire words (patch #2842461)
escape regex characters in whole word search
fix whole word search
Entire word search rewritten : now the search is done as usual, then before returning the result it is checked to be a whole word, if not, the next result is searched (and checked).  A whole word has the following conditions :    start of word :  beginning of the line  starts with a symbol or space  char before the first char is a symbol or space    end of word:  end of line  ends with  a symbol or space  char next to the last char is a symbol or space
use of getSmartCaseReplace() instead of inline code
Added support for find previous when searching in multiple files
Tabsize=4.  
Made fetching noWordSep property consistent with the majority of code.   In most cases it seems to be more suitable to read it from buffer   (like in TextArea), not from mode.
Fixed bug #3522497, "Whole word" option does not work in Replace   with "Extra word characters", patch #3543524 Malathi
Fix File status checking after buffer switch (#1871440 Alan Ezust)  
Clean up conversion to Task API. Patch 3560625. 
fixed indent size since tabs are only 4 spaces width
several small fixes: spelling, unused imports, use createVFSSessionSafe in DirectoryListSet
1. Revert class -> enum conversion of TaskManager 2. Fix warnings in jEdit class
Fix mode loading for temporary buffers
