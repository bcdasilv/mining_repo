make the natives report prettier; remove some unused strings from the Messages file; kept other unused ones that ought to be used; amended capitalisation of labels per English standards
make the labour report look more like what it was supposed to look like: fixes to column/row confusion that caused horizontal scrolling, reduce insets and unused columns to zero width, fix boolean logic errors in two places. the detailed report still has issues especially when buildings, at sea or on land are needed
scouts speaking to the chief should make contact (inc. beads/tales reward, learnable skill and wanted goods) even if another european nation has been there before
Revert 8608 and 8610 and apply patch from Thomas to fix BR#3321952.

The monarch now becomes displeased if a subject accepts an offer of mercenaries but evades full payment.  Displeasure disables further offers of land support.

Attempt to distinguish basic and unit modifiers from other modifiers.

rewrite ImageLibrary.getUnitImageIcon() to be more logical, robust and capable. Can now handle drawing units with native appearance, if artwork is available. Calls itself recursivly with simpler arguments if more specific artwork was not found. Cannot yet handle different appearance for different nations though.
add unit icons for native free colonist and native soldier
Make panels transparent to avoid "stripes". 
I just realised that the 006 image is meant to be 6.25% not 6%. Also re-exported trimmed photoshop files without white padding.
units should be 6.25% not 6%

Respect restrictions in enter-colony unit type changes.
Make getProductionOf abstract in WorkLocation, eliminating the non-OO "instanceof {Building,ColonyTile}" tests.

Fixes to the list of units in the end turn dialog:  - Ignore units under repair, fixing BR#????. - Fix code that should have been showing sentried units in Europe   with a carrier available, but tighten the requirements so that the   carrier must have enough space for the unit. - However prevent the above fix from ignoring ships in Europe, - ...while ignoring units in Europe that are already on a carrier.
Fix file names, *AGAIN*!

Make ColopediaPanel modular and pave the way for concept entries.
Demonstrate colopedia concepts.
Add description for founding fathers section.
Expand description of taxes.
Fix collapseElements.
Rewrite adjustProductionAndManufacture.  - Remove deprecated ColonyTile.getUnit. - Use getBuildingsForProducing. - Use WorkLocations instead of ColonyTiles. - Check the build queue requirements directly instead of hard wiring hammers   and tools. - Fix comments in the test code that refered to cotton when the code   uses sugar. - Use CARGO_SIZE for goods amount comparisons.
Generalize to use getBuilding**s**ForConsuming, rather than the singular form.

Add dumping of messages to AIs.

Added an improved picture of a wild game

Added an improved sugar resource picture
Split Colony.getWorkLocations into three specific forms.  - getCurrentWorkLocations: gets the work locations currently owned by the       colony.  This is usually the one to use for colony status operations. - getFreeWorkLocations:    gets the work locations currently owned by the       colony, plus those that can be freely claimed.  This is useful when       considering a potential expansion of the colony. - getAllWorkLocations:  gets all work locations, regardless of ownership.       Only used in serialization ATM.
Fix serialization problem.
Don't serialize minimum and maximum values if they are default values.

Further work on REF size option.
Do not consider ships under repair as useable carriers, fixing BR#3420944.
Localisation updates from translatewiki.net 
Test WorkLocation.getPotentialProduction.
Unify form of child element serialization.  Try to keep things simple--- the single argument form of writeChildren works everywhere except where there are `hidden' children, such as the units working inside a settlement, where you need the multi-argument form.  Do not mix them!  Any class that has hidden children, or classes that implement hidden children should always use the multi-argument form.  Anywhere this degrades to the single argument form the behaviour becomes either too generous (players can see each other's hidden children) or too restrictive (players can not see their own hidden children).
Fix native surrender lossage (BR#3419068).
Revert 9083 until work is properly done.

Added an improved version of the Tobacco resource picture

Fix broken compatibility code. 
Broaden Connection name to DummyConnections.
More comprehensive c-s communication tracing with another debug level.
Enable colopedia concept panel to use html.
Unify c-s comms dump into one routine.  This replaces the old BufferedInputStream dumping that only covered comms to players, and had a size limit.  Unfortunately streamed messages such as "login" are no longer covered, however this will be fixed in due course.

Prevent ships being classed as persons.  This is a bit curly because isPerson is allowing the foundColony ability to signify a person for backward compatibility reasons. We will lose this in due course (and just rely on model.ability.person) but ATM ships are picking up the Player-level foundColony (which is true for Europeans), so they need to be explicitly told they are not able to found colonies --- Unit.hasAbility sorts this out, but it is a bit non-obvious, hence this long comment.
Similarly, wagons are not persons either.

Another bug fix and cleanup of path finding.  - Found and fixed a nasty problem with path finding where direct but slower   (in turns) paths would be preferred over slightly longer but faster ones   that used a carrier. - We have Unit.findPath.  Make sure we use it wherever possible, and   Unit.findPathToEurope, and add Unit.search.  Almost all code now   uses these, which are cleaner and clearer. - Drop the multiple versions of Map.{findPath,search}, except for the   special unit-less forms which should still be called directly, underlining   that they are special. - Code cleanups (indenting, documentation).
Fixed a stacktrace due to too fast removal of code.

More AI colony collapse avoidance.
Quantify the connected tile attribute.  Improve the `connected to Europe' attribute by converting it to an integer (with adequate backward compatibility) containing the number of tiles to a tile directly connected to the high seas.  This allows the colony site evaluator to score coastal sites *without* having to call the expensive path finding code at every tile.  In passing, renamed related functions that were slightly misleading: Tile.isCoast -> isShore Tile.isConnected -> isHighSeasConnected Tile.canMoveToEurope -> canMoveToHighSeas TileType.isConnected -> isHighSeasConnected Settlement.isConnected -> isConnectedPort Unit.canMoveToEurope -> canMoveToHighSeas added TileType.isDirectlyHighSeasConnected added Tile.get/setHighSeasCount removed unnecessary Colony.isConnected  ...but not Player.canMoveToEurope, as that directly tests for the presence of Europe, whereas the above all look at map properties.  Removed special case of map edge water tiles allowing a direct move to Europe.  However the highSeasCount calculation still applies an explicit positive "moveToEurope" attribute override to non-highSeas tiles with the "connected" type attribute that are on the vertical edges.  This keeps the test suite maps working, but should not affect any of the standard maps.
